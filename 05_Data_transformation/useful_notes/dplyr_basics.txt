5.1.3 dplyr basics
In this chapter you are going to learn the five key dplyr functions that allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges:

Pick observations by their values (filter()).
Reorder the rows (arrange()).
Pick variables by their names (select()).
Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).
These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.


All verbs work similarly:

The first argument is a data frame.

The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes).

The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result. Letâ€™s dive in and see how these verbs work.
